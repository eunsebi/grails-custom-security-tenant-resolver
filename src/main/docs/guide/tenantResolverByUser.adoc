Alternatively, you may want to use a combination of Stateless 
endpoints secured by Spring Security REST and Stateful endpoints secured by Spring Security Core. You will be interested to 
create a custom resolver by the current logged in user.

[source,groovy]
.src/main/groovy/demo/CurrentUserTenantResolver.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/../complete-currentuser/src/main/groovy/demo/CurrentUserTenantResolver.groovy[]

<1> When using discriminator-based multi-tenancy then you may need to implement the http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/api/org/grails/datastore/mapping/multitenancy/AllTenantsResolver.html[AllTenantsResolver] interface in your TenantResolver implentation if you want to at any point iterate over all available tenants. `AllTenantsResolver extends `TenantResolver`. To create your own tenant resolver implement `org.grails.datastore.mapping.multitenancy.TenantResolver`.

Define the Custom Tenant Resolver as a bean:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/../complete-currentuser/grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy[tag=currentUserTenantResolverImport]
include::{sourceDir}/../complete-currentuser/grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy[tag=beans]
include::{sourceDir}/../complete-currentuser/grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy[tag=currentUserTenantResolver]
}
----

Create an Integration Test to test the custom Tenant Resolver.

[source,groovy]
.src/integration-test/groovy/demo/CurrentUserTenantResolverSpec.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/../complete-currentuser/src/integration-test/groovy/demo/CurrentUserTenantResolverSpec.groovy[]
----

Next were are going to configure our app to use this custom tenant resolver. 

Configure Multi-Tenancy by modifying `application.yml`.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
grails
include::{sourceDir}/../complete-currentuser/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=multiTenancyConfiguration]
----

<1> Define Multi-Tenancy mode as `DISCRIMINATOR`
<2> Set the Tenant Resolver class with a custom class which you will write later in this guide.
